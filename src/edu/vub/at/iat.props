#iat shell properties
# valid options are:
# name: name of the program
# version: version information
# inputprompt: the prompt shown when iat requests input
# outputprompt: the prompt prefixed to the output of evaluation
# readprompt: the prompt shown when code executes a read or readln
# help: the text to show when the user asks for help

help = usage: iat [options] [file] [arguments]\n \
Environment variables used by iat:\n \
AT_HOME: path to the AmbientTalk home directory (used to find the native libraries) \n \
AT_OBJECTPATH: default objectpath to use \n \
\n \
Command Line Options: \n \
 -i, --init init-file: specifies which file to load as the preamble of the language \n \
    (the content of this file is evaluated in the context of the global lexical root) \n \
 -o, --objectpath objectpath: specifies the object-path, a list of directories separated by ':' \n \
    which contain the necessary libraries \n \
 -e, --eval codestring: evaluates the given codestring and ignores the filename \n \
 -p, --print print value of last evaluated expression, then quit instead of entering REPL \n \
 -n, --network name specify the name of the overlay network to join \n \
 -h, --help display help, then quit \n \
 -v, --version display version information, then quit \n \
 -q, --quiet quiet mode - don't print welcome message or any prompts \n \
\n \
Program arguments:\n \
 an optional filename and optional arguments to the script\n \
\n \
Program behaviour:\n \
 iat evaluates the code in the argument file, if one is given, then enters a read-eval-print loop\n \
 (unless -p was specified, in which case it prints out the last evaluated expression and quits)\n \
 \nDuring the execution of iat, the lexical root contains a 'system' object which can be used to interface\n \
 with the outside world. Also, all name=directory pairs specified in the objectpath are accessible as slots\n \
 in the 'lobby' namespace.\n
