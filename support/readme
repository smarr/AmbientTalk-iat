This is the binary distribution of the AmbientTalk/2 interpreter.

A quick tour of what's included:
- AmbientTalk 2.tmbundle: the TextMate support bundle, simply drag it on to TextMate, if you have that application installed.
- iat (mac/linux) / iat.bat (windows): the shell script that starts the interactive ambienttalk shell (iat).
- ambienttalk2.jar: the code for the AT/2 interpreter, preferably to be ran via the iat script
- at: the 'system library' that is shipped with the language. As a user, you can modify the files, but at your own risk :-)
- lib: external Java libraries for the interpreter

Do not forget to set the value of the AT_HOME environment variable when running iat from within TextMate.

Note to windows users: iat.bat has been reported not to work when the AT_HOME directory contains spaces, so consider placing your AmbientTalk distribution in a directory that does not contain spaces.

For service discovery, AmbientTalk makes use of IP multicasting. AmbientTalk broadcasts messages to IP 244.0.0.1 on port 4446. Make sure your firewall does not block this port.
