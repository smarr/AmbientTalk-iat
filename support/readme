AmbientTalk/2 Project
Copyright (c)  2006-2010 Software Languages Lab

AmbientTalk/2 was originally designed by Tom Van Cutsem and Stijn Mostinckx,
based on the AmbientTalk/1 language by Jessie Dedecker.

AmbientTalk is now developed and maintained by the Ambient Group at SOFT:

This is the binary distribution of the AmbientTalk/2 interpreter.

A quick tour of what's included:
- iat (mac/linux) / iat.bat (windows): the shell script that starts the
  interactive ambienttalk shell (iat).
- ambienttalk2.jar: the code for the AT/2 interpreter, preferably to be
  ran via the iat script
- atlib: the 'system library' that is shipped with the language.
  As a user, you can modify the files, but at your own risk :-)
- jlib: external Java libraries for the interpreter

If you run iat from within the TextMate editor on Mac OS X, do not forget
to set the AT_HOME environment variable.

Note to windows users: iat.bat has been reported not to work when the
AT_HOME directory contains spaces, so consider placing your AmbientTalk
distribution in a directory that does not contain spaces.

For service discovery, AmbientTalk makes use of IP multicasting.
AmbientTalk broadcasts messages to IP 244.0.0.1 on port 4446.
Make sure your firewall does not block this port.
